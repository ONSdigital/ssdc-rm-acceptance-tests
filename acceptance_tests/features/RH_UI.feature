Feature: Testing the "enter a UAC" functionality of RH UI

  Scenario Outline: Entering a bad UAC and error section displayed X
    Given the UAC entry page is displayed for "<language code>"
    When the user enters UAC "PK39HN572FZFVHLQ"
    Then an error section is headed "<error section header>" and href "#uac_invalid" is "<expected error text>"
    And link text displays string "<expected link test>"

    Examples:
      | language code | expected error text                                          | error section header               | expected link test                                           |
      | en            | Access code not recognised. Enter the code again.            | There is a problem with this page  | Access code not recognised. Enter the code again.            |

  Scenario Outline: Works with a good UAC
    Given sample file "CRIS_dummy_1_row.csv" is loaded successfully
    And and we request a UAC by SMS and the UAC is ready and RH page has "<expected text>" for "<language code>"
    And the user enters a valid UAC
    Then they are redirected to EQ with the correct token and language set to "<language code>"
    And UAC_UPDATE message is emitted with active set to true and "eqLaunched" is true

    Examples:
      | language code | expected text                           |
      | en            | Start study - ONS Surveys               |
      | cy            | Dechrau'r astudiaeth - Arolygon SYG     |
