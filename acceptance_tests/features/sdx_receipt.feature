  Scenario: A case is loaded and can be receipted
    Given sample file "sample_1_limited_address_fields.csv" is loaded successfully
    And an email template has been created with template uac_qid
    And fulfilments are authorised on email template
    When a request has been made for a replacement UAC by email from email address "foo@bar.baz"
